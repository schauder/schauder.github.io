The developers and speakers at conferences can tell you how awesome their development practices are. 
But when you visit the people in the trenches of large corporations or those in the 1-3 person IT department of a small company things look very different. 
And even the hip guys pushing the latest JS framework seem to have forgotten (or never heard) the wisdom from the 70s and the 80s.

This talk will point out core practices that everyone needs to follow when working as a professional software developer.
And since there more stuff of this kind than can possibly fit into a  single talk, there will also be a lengthy list of resources.
