JPA is the most popular persistence technology for JAVA. 
In this talk, we'll look into how it works and how it integrates with Spring by means of Spring Data JPA.
We'll look at the various ways one may use Spring Data from ready-made queries over query derivation, query by example, specifications, paging and sorting to custom method implementations.

We'll also take a look at common pitfalls of JPA and how to circumvent them.
And if time is left we'll take a glance at other technologies available to Java developers to complement JPA and how these integrate with Spring Data.
