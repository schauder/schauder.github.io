<p>I love E-Mail. E-Mail doesn't interrupt, it quietly sits there until you have time for it. E-Mail allows you to carefully think about what you want to say, and edit it if you change your mind. E-Mail is permanent, so you can look up what you were asked and what you replied and if necessary you can even prove it.</p>
<p>Yet there are times when you definetly must use a phone (or if possible just walk over to that office):</p>
<p>If you are getting angry use the phone (Not because more satisfactory to shout on the phone) . On the phone you will heare the nuances in the voice and in general get way more information across the wire. Chances are the insult in the last E-Mail was just unlucky wording, and the problem is solved soon, once people start talking to each other.</p>
<p>If the recipient is busy and doesn't know about the importance of your request. It is a little mean to interrupt someone who is busy, but sometime you don't have a choice. If you get 50 or 100 E-Mails a day sooner or later you will start filtering really aggressively. And even if an E-Mail isn't&Acirc;&nbsp; actively categorized as 'not that important' might just happen it slips through. And the sender will never know. He just won't get an answer.</p>
<p>It is hard to ignore somebody on the phone. And even harder to ignore him without him noticing. So if you need to <a href="&#47;2009&#47;03&#47;19&#47;getting-stuff-done&#47;">get stuff done<&#47;a> by somebody pick up the phone and tell them. Just for the record you might add a confirmation mail afterwards.</p>
