  content: Please do not blindly accept the controversial demotion of Pluto, which
    was done by only four percent of the IAU, most of whom are not planetary scientists,
    and was rejected by hundreds of professional astronomers in a petition led by
    Dr. Alan Stern, Principal Investigator of NASA's New Horizons misson to Pluto.
    Stern and like-minded scientists support a broader planet definition that includes
    any non-self-luminous spheroidal body orbiting a star. The spherical part is important
    because it means an object is large enough to have been pulled into a round shape
    by its own gravity. This is a characteristic of planets, not of shapeless asteroids.
    The view that Pluto is a "former planet" is only one interpretation of reality
    in an ongoing debate, not fact, as some think it is.

<p>This is the third part in my little series of <a href="&#47;2009&#47;04&#47;08&#47;mental-training-part-one&#47;">training tips<&#47;a> for <a href="&#47;2009&#47;04&#47;14&#47;mental-training-part-two&#47;">your brain<&#47;a>. I call this one:</p>
<p><strong>Where is the missing link?<&#47;strong></p>
<p>Pick any two things, events or persons. For example the person working at the local bakery and the cestial body formerly known as 'planet pluto'. What is the connection between those two? Can you come up with a short story or scene, where both play an important role. Or a comparison? "His rolls are as cold as the surface of pluto." Or does he travel to pluto to concur with some aliens in order to exchange recipies? This of course would explain his long vacations.</p>
<p>It will train your creativity for sure. I am convinced that creativity is a skill that needs training just as every other skill as well.</p>
