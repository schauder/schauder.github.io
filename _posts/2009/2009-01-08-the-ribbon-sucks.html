    like it,besides MS did something out of the box with ribbon,and it isn't a disaster

  content: "Personally, I hate the damned ribbon. I find it a hinderance rather than
    useful because it can be a real pain to find a command. However, some people (generally
    those who are not long-time users of Office) do seem to really like the thing.\r\n\r\nI
    agree whole-heartedly that Microsoft should have included an option for showing
    the menus instead.\r\n\r\nI spoke with a chap at Microsoft about this and he was
    really quite defensive. I guess he gets it a lot as he was very quickly able to
    produce a nice PowerPoint presentation explaining why there was a problem that
    needed the ribbon to fix it. Basically, he said there were too many functions
    for menus to show. Of course, this is still the case with the Ribbon and seems
    to be even worse."

    a large amount of commands. As I described above: this is exactly what doesn't
    work for me.\r\n\r\nI am aware that many people do like the ribbon and of course
    that is fine. Actually I'm curious about what people do like about the ribbon.
    So if somebody could shed some light on that it would be apreciated"

    to print a simple document and I just was trying to bring up the old print dialog
    so I could set a range of pages to print. This SIMPLE TASK TOOK ABOUT 10 MINUTES
    because of how unintuitive the new interface was. Microsoft rightly believes that
    if the user interface didn't change then people don't notice:\r\nhttp://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001208.html\r\n
    The real problem is the interface should always move toward simplification not
    complexity, the UI designers just got the Ribbon design all wrong. Too complex
    and it really didn't simplify the UI. EPIC FAIL..."

    we've gained by effectively learning how to work with menus over the last 10 years.\r\n\r\nThe
    notion that the standard menus could not have been provided as an option is simply
    foolish.  And Microsoft wonders why Vista is simply being rejected by corporations
    everywhere.  Every new vistafied computer I buy promptly get's erased, reformatted,
    and installed with XP.\r\n\r\nI'm not interested in what MS thinks is \"better\".
    \ It's my software, I bought it and I expect to be able to use it without having
    the rug pulled out from under me."

  content: i totally agree. In fact, if the ribbon had come before toolbars and menus
    we would be talking about how easy menus are in comparison. At most toolbars are
    an imporved toolbar... but only if implemented correctly.  If you are giong to
    have a ribbon make it optional and always include a menu. There are very very
    very few programs that should not have a menu. even simple programs often function
    better with a menu. for me this entire ribbon nonsense (And most of vista) is
    part of microsofts attempt to keep up the MAC. However, a MAC like OS only appeals
    to people who are predispositioned to like Macs. But they will never like a PC
    that wants to be a MAC as much as a MAC. So why try to compete and alienate those
    customers that prefer regular old windows.

  content: "Thank you for this site!\r\nPersonnaly, I really HATE the ribbons. I stopped
    the use of Microsoft Office Applications in the CLASSROOM since MS Office 2007.
    Since then, we still use Office 2003, because Office 2007 (and probably 2010,
    as well)  is no more 'teachable'. The only way to discover it's silly dynamics
    of changing menus is TRIAL and ERROR. - Now I seriously recommend the use of LINUX
    (like UBUNTU) and OPEN OFFICE + other open source - alternatives. If you mention
    those programs, please only judge after profound empirical analysis (we tested
    it until today with more than THOUSAND users (!), and it is very well done. Now
    think about it in terms of COST ANALYSIS: you can pay Linux-professionals during
    the process of conversion, and still spend much less than with expensive MS software.
    Most users only need 5% of the functions, and all those functions are well-done
    in open source - software!"

    took clean, uniform, linear, minimalist toolbars, and replaced them with a big
    cartoonish crazy jumbled clusterfck of a gui.  Makes perfect sense.  And what's
    more, Autodesk thinks it's such a great idea, they've started to incorporate it
    too for 2010, in a collapsable three-tiered pile of multiple subcategory pull-downs
    that guarantee you'll be hunting and digging around for the few dozen of the ten
    million commands you need to use their programs.\r\n\r\nThis ribbon is a virus
    of the mind."

  content: The ribbon is a heart-ache... Microsoft annoyed the hell out of me because
    their operating systems have always been full of shitty things that made things
    more difficult than they needed to be for no good reason, but I forgave then because
    I really liked Excel and I quite liked Word. Now the ribbon has changed all that...
    once in at least every day I will spend ten minutes trying to do something in
    Word or Excel that used to be intuitive, and I get quite angry (which is not like
    me).... all criticsms of the ribbon are valid, I have yet to hear what is good
    about it. I had already figured out that there is a mole from Google or Sun involvd.
    However, Windows 7 is starting to show signs of improvement on the OS front. One
    of the things I always hate about Linux whenever I install it (for a few weeks
    every now and again) is the lack of a clear and clean menu structure and stupid
    meaningless icons and I spend a week getting wireless working and then I spend
    a week trying to find a decent picture viewer and then a week trying to do something
    else and then I realise I don't have time for this. I have downloaded Open Office
    (for Windows) it actually looks quite nice and it opens Office docs and its Excel
    even has asolver and a choice of macro programming languages.

    would have chosen that as an option - and then the IDIOTS who designed 'The Ribbon'
    would have had their precious egos shattered, AND have to explain to Microsoft
    just why they came up with such a crap interface.\r\n\r\nIn other words, like
    Lefties everywhere, they give you only ONE option, thus FORCING it on you, and
    call that 'progress'.\r\n\r\nThe 'Ribbon' is the antithesis of good interface
    design. Everything about it is wrong. Drop down menus work perfectly, they rely
    on spatial memory, which is how we all remember where things are. The 'Ribbon'
    is like playing 'find the lady', trying to guess under which tab the command that
    you want, is hiding.\r\n\r\nThe idiots at Microsoft who came up with this disaster
    also came up with loads of other ridiculous interface 'ideas', you can see this
    on Youtube when the Dickwad in Charge (I forget his name) actually showed the
    world all the stupid designs his 'team' (of idiots) had come up with, prior to
    forcing the pile of shite that is 'The Ribbon' onto us all...\r\n\r\nIn other
    words, those idiots couldn't just leave the current system in place, drop down
    menus, because then they would have been out of a job! So what complete and utter
    cretin in Microsoft PAID them in the first place?"

  content: "I'm not an IT expert, only a programs average user, since the days of
    Windows 3.1. I currently use several programs for my job duties, so I'm not in
    principle afraid of any new program and/or UI; the most difficult to master
    with personal satisfaction being MS Office 2007.\r\n\r\nI work in academia, and
    being in a multicultural environment I have colleagues from all over the world.
    Some of them use Japanese or Chinese versions of  Windows and Office. In the recent
    past (meaning WinXP/Office 2003), when one of them was off and we needed to
    look in their PC for some badly needed document and maybe modify it, with the
    help of the menus it was still possible, even if all the menus were in Japanese!\r\nThis
    because of the spatial memory. Now, with the ribbon, I don't think I would be
    able to do it any more... because, even using my own language, in Office 2007
    everything gets confused. As an example, to do a chart in Excel (simple average
    bars with Std-Dev Custom error bars and a Chart Title) I should wander through
    endless tabs clicking several more buttons than before.\r\nOn another side, to
    have all the commands \"handy\" I have a two-lines Command bar (of which I can
    only see one line for some irrational reason unless I click the usual pin-sized
    hidden button) usually full of Commands taken from Blob-->Word Options-->Customize-->\"Commands
    not in the Ribbon\" (moronic admission that \"something\" is missing in there!).\r\n\r\nIf
    I was submitting a project grant that was suggesting something akin to the disaster
    that came off with MSO2007, due to peer review it would have been hopelelssly
    axed (and maybe i was fired as a consequence). MS clearly does not have a peer
    review of their projects, nor does kick out incompetent people."

    know one end of a computer from the other, and probably has palpitations just
    thinking about installing the menu bar fix, and would rather watch his whole company
    collapse than admit he is wrong.\r\n\r\nWatch the Youtube videos on 'the Ribbon'
    where the head of the 'design' team (cough, cough) explains why they came up with
    this pile of crap. These people are living in another world and couldn't care
    less how many millions of hours of people's time is wasted because of THEIR stupidity.
    The Ribbon sucks, and that is all there is to it. \r\n\r\nBut will Microsoft ever
    admit they are wrong? Will they bring out a new version of Office with the 'classic'
    (i.e. normal, functional, working) menus? But the design team behind it will be
    the same douchebags who came up with 'The Ribbon', so they will fight tooth and
    nail against normal menus, otherwise they would have to admit they were wrong.
    Which is exactly the sort of people who you DON'T want designing a user interface...
    since the only opinions that matter are those of the users, not the fools who
    work for Microsoft."

    functions you need in each unique-as-a-snowflake application, don't mind the fact
    that MS just flushed your 10 years of experience working with menus, and never
    have to try to describe to someone how to perform a function e.g. no more 'choose

  content: As an IT Professional at a small plant within a large company, we are finally
    migrating to Office 2007 (but still for now running Windows XP).  This was not
    an easy choice, but, one that will be required sooner than later at this point.  We
    are in fact a "trial" group - given that only about 30 users exist.  We broke
    the users up in the typical "user", "power user" , "super user" categories, and
    made the swap - to super and power users first.  This has been going on for 6
    months.  There are no complaints now, and I have not been called to a desk to
    assist in quite a while.  I have to use both O2k3 and O2k7, and retain knowledge
    of both, as I support both.  One big difference at our facility (to others in
    the same company) was that a "migration" docment was created using a small group
    covering 90% of what people used Excel/Word/Power Point for.  We don't
    use Outlook, and rarely use Access.  In fact, we won't roll out Access 2007 as
    several older apps need to be upgraded to get it to work - they are being migrated
    to SQL Server.  So - be patient, you can learn the ribbon.  90% of users will
    adapt very, very quickly, provided you have prepared properly for the move.  Most
    people complained loudly when they moved from Word Perfect DOS to Word Perfect
    for Windows, and then, later from WPW to Word 97.  It's healthy to vent our fustrations!  And
    a few years from now, we will all be fluent with the ribbon and have forgotten
    all about it!

  content: "The ribbon, or the where's waldo, interface is a time suck. It's probably
    the first interface I've run across that isn't getting any better. I've even wasted
    time customizing and it's still like playing a game of concentration. I'm always
    surprised how many people write off complaints as mere opposition to change and
    leaving a comfort zone. Sometimes complaints are valid and based on solid reasons.
    The ribbon is ineffective for anyone but a newbie who isn't aware of more than
    the most basic functions. Office is too feature heavy to start with and hiding
    access to features is really a bad idea. I guess the one bright spot is that OpenOffice
    is getting better every day and at this point a menu bar is a real selling point.\r\n\r\nFor
    those who haven't found it yet, I find myself minimizing the ribbon completely
    so only the  tabs are visible. Removing the cluttered and busy eyesore removes
    distracting random icons and doesn't really slow things down much since it takes
    ten minutes every time I go to the ribbon anyway. The new ribbon workflow is stop
    your current train of thought and go  spelunking around for the desired action
    then return to work. Turning off the ribbon while working makes the process two
    separate modes; one mode is productively working the other is wandering around
    searching with the ribbon exposed."

    If your objective is to write and deploy macro applications that are used repeatedly,
    not having a toolbar to float or dock where you want is just plain dumb. \r\n\r\nI'm
    sorta wondering why the ribbon can't be one giant uberbar that can be used alongside
    an array of user-created ones. That way, most people get what they want. On balance,
    people who really care about Office just don't like the ribbon. That's just how
    it is.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft: If you want to do something useful and keep all your
    people busy, rewrite the whole suite in managed code so .NET can be integrated
    without a colossal COM-interface performance penalty."

    the hang of Movie Maker (that came with Windows XP) easily.  But I can't get the
    hang of the Windows 7 version because of this damn ribbon bar.  It's very anti-productive,
    it takes much longer to learn the program and I've just given up trying.\r\n\r\nBefore,
    you had a toolbar for frequently used commands and you could customise that to
    your liking.  You also had the menu bar which featured every option in the program.
    \ You got to know where the options were that you liked and you added the menu
    items you wanted to use often to your toolbar.  That was a perfect system.\r\n\r\nNow
    the ribbon bar comes and I don't know where anything is.  The ribbon keeps changing
    all the time, I can't keep track of where I am or what I'm doing, I keep getting
    confused.  I don't like the fact that it puts tabs in the window title bar.  I
    don't like the fact that the ribbon seems to be a set of toolbars with tabs.  I
    don't want a set of toolbars.  I want one toolbar with menus.\r\n\r\nI've always
    been a Microsoft fan and supported their Windows OS enormously.  But since Windows
    7, they seem to be intent on changing things just for the sake of it.  There's
    a team at Microsoft that thinks something needs changing, this is a change so
    we must do it.  But it's making their software worse!  They don't even seem to
    step back and look at what they've done.\r\n\r\nThe Windows 7 Superbar, I spent
    ages trying to get used to it as best I could but I never liked it as much as
    the old taskbar.  I've tried to put the taskbar back in Windows 7 and it mostly
    works, but you can't turn the window previews off, it's very frustrating.\r\n\r\nIE8
    is another example.  It's always been feature rich with its page progress bar,
    proper status bar and easy downloading.  Then modern Microsoft came along and
    ruined it with iE9.  The page progress bar is scrapped, the status bar is useless
    and the automatic downloader tries to do everything for you, screwing it all up
    as it does.\r\n\r\nThen on top of all that we get the ribbon bar.  Yet another
    useless change that has made the software unusable for me.  I don't like Microsoft
    anymore, they used to set themselves apart from the competition by offering quality
    and ease of use over anything else.  Then this \"modern Microsoft\" came along
    and now nothing seems to matter other than making your program look new and flashy,
    to the horror of traditional Microsoft fans worldwide."

    money to replace a perfectly functional program with one that you HATE to use.
    Yeah, I can work with the annoying ribbons, but the previous menu system was far
    easier to navigate &amp; search. Although the \"adaptive menus\" changed which
    commands were displayed depending on what you you use (who doesn't like to search
    for commands that move &amp; disappear?), you could turn that useless feature
    off. Why Microsoft is forcing the ribbon on us (and removing any way of reverting
    to menus) I don't know - it's like they're punishing us for using their products.
    Office 2010 looks pale &amp; washed out too, so the active window never really
    looks active. Most apps have a dark blue header at the top when they're active,
    but not Office 2010 - it just changes from light blue/gray to a slightly darker
    light blue/gray. They always tell us that the new interface is the BEST, but
    doesn't that mean they were wrong when they told us that the LAST interface was
    \"the best\"? For a lot of users, making the jump from Office XP to Office 2007
    or 2010 is a real headache. I have only met one person who doesn't hateit \r\nOffice

<p>If you are working with Office 2007 you know the Ribbon. If you don't you are a lucky bastard.</p>
<p>Although Office has many bugs and is a major case of feature bloat, but up to now I always stood up to defend it, because most of the stuff I use works ok, and that is probably more than 90% of the Office Users use. AND alternatives aren't really there yet. Ok there is Open Office but the last time I looked at it, it was horrible, ugly, buggy and IMHO only usable for private use.</p>
<p>But now the ribbon enters the room. At least in the way it is implemented in Office it is the biggest usability road block short of a system crash. But first what is this ribbon thing anyway?</p>
<p>The ribbon is a GUI Component which replaces the menu bar and the toolbar found in so many applications. It looks like this:</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.schauderhaft.de/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/ribbon.jpg" title="The Ribbon"><img src="http://blog.schauderhaft.de/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/ribbon.jpg" alt="The Ribbon" width="559" height="96" /></a></p>
<p>(Click on the image for a full size version)</p>
<p>At first sight it looks just like a menu bar + a toolbar with different size icons and other elements in it. But this is a misconception.</p>
<ul>
<li> The menu bar is not really a menu bar but tabs, which one uses to switch between different toolbars.</li>
<li>There is an additional thingy on the top which contains some actions like save, undo and redo called the Qick Access Toolbar:<br />
<a href="http://blog.schauderhaft.de/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/shortcut.jpg" title="Quick Access Toolbar"><img src="http://blog.schauderhaft.de/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/shortcut.jpg" alt="Quick Access Toolbar" /></a></li></p>
<li>The is a big ugly bubble like icon which is actually a button, which is more or less the file menu:<br />

</ul><br />
If you are a developer there is also a document for you which describes, <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc872782.aspx">how you are supposed to use the ribbon component</a> in the applications you create.</p>
<p>So what is wrong with all this?</p>
<p>Let&Acirc;&acute;s start with the minor annoyances:</p>
<p>The more important commands in the Ribbon should get larger icons. Great. Just nobody asked me what is important for me. For example the different layouts you can view a word document with are NOT important for me. For me the whole concept of different layouts for viewing cut go away. I wouldn't miss it. It actually would be an improvement, because it would stop word from opening documents 'for full screen reading'.</p>
<p>Who had the weird idea that a two column menu (like the windows start button or the ribbon application button) is a good idea? It is probably the same guy that came up with the idea to add two buttons and a weird extra panel to the menu. Why there aren't just three more menu items labeled 'Recent Documents', 'Options' and 'Exit'? I have no idea.</p>
<p>But now it is getting serious, at least for me. For me toolbars and menus had two very distinct purposes: Toolbars where for quickly accessing stuff. Since I mostly use keyboard stuff for thing I need often. I don't use toolbars to much. Menus are for looking up commands that I know are somewhere, but I don't know the shortcut. In this case I look at the available menus, pick the one that sounds promising, and scan all the items in it. This approach completely fails with the ribbon!</p>
<p>Microsoft completely messed up the grouping of commands.<br />
The design guide says explicitly:</p>
<blockquote><p>Avoid arbitrary command placement. Suppose that you think you have a good tab and group design, but discover that several commands just don't fit in. Chances are, your tab and group design isn't as good as you think it is, and you need to continue to refine it. Don't solve this problem by putting those commands where they don't belong. If you do, users likely will have to inspect every tab to find them&acirc;&euro;&rdquo;then promptly forget where they are.</blockquote><br />
Yet every single office app has a 'home' tab which is just a glorified 'other stuff' which contains arbitrary stuff. But  even within the proper tabs things are of: What has recording macros to do with 'view'? Why is stuff named '... layout' not in the 'Page Layout'?</p>
<p>Even when the grouping of commands would have been done properly Microsoft did a great job at making searching the commands hard. With menus searching all items in the menus was really easy: Start with the first menu, go through it item by item. If an item is a submenu, continue with that submenu. When you finish a menu, go to the next menu. If you finish with a submenu, continue with the next item of the parent menu.</p>
<p>For the Ribbon the whole thing got way more difficult. First you scan the application menu. Don't forget the two buttons in the application menu. Then iterate through the tabs scanning each toolbar within that tab, carefully checking the buttons for tiny triangles, which denote some combo box like control which hides even more commands. Ok scanning the cluttered toolbars, with text, icons in two sizes and all kinds of other controls is way slower than a nice list of commands/submenus but that isn't too bad, isn't it. Well it would be if we hadn't missed 50% of the commands. Have a look at this partial screenshot.</p>
<p>Below the buttons and stuff is another grouping. It is completely useless since your eyes are coming from the tabs and get stuck between the buttons and controls before they notice, after a long search, that their search might have been easier if they had noticed the groups below first. What is more important is the tiny square with an arrow which is in some of the groups. It opens another dialog which sometimes looks like a menu and many actions are hidden in there.</p>
<p>So this is it, my rant about the Microsoft Ribbon Component. I actually don't like rants. I like my blog posts to contain some useful stuff. So what are my recommendations?</p>
<p>If you plan to include a Ribbon in your next application think twice. It will look modern, but it will annoy users like me. You could make them happy with an option to replace the Ribbon with a more traditional UI. If you want to make users like me really happy make your menus searchable. In Java you can do that really easy with the <a href="http://www.pushing-pixels.org/?p=1046">substance look and feel</a> it creates a search box for searching the menus all on its own ... really nice.</p>
