  content: "Actually, I wasn't working with Oracle on this. My repeated \"thanks\"
    to Oracle is for the plethora of tools they provide out-of-the-(rather expensive)-box.\r\n\r\nBut
    enough people out there ask for it, maybe they will see some value in adding more
    support for something like this. At the very least, we can open source our project,
    and all work together to make the whole process a lot smoother."

<p>I try to minimize the use of database specific programming languages like PL&#47;SQL. It is just annoying to work with a language that is just badly designed and has hardly any serious tool support. It (and the IDEs around it) is lacking in so many ways. All the things I would expect from the most basic development environment are missing.</p>
<p>Yet sometimes we can&acirc;&euro;&trade;t help it and just have to use PL&#47;SQL for performance or political reasons, but it really hurts.<br />
And the frustrating part: Nobody seems to care.</p>
<p>Nobody? There are a few guys working on these things. I wrote <a href="&#47;2008&#47;12&#47;19&#47;news-on-testing-for-databases&#47;">about Tim High<&#47;a> before. Yesterday he left a <a href="&#47;2008&#47;12&#47;19&#47;news-on-testing-for-databases&#47;#comment-136">comment<&#47;a> on the post to inform me that he wrote another article that might interest me. Completely superfluous. I already picked it up on DZone and marked it for future reference in my blog. So here it is:</p>
<p><a href="http:&#47;&#47;timhigh.wordpress.com&#47;2009&#47;02&#47;17&#47;test-coverage-reporting-on-oracle-10g&#47;trackback&#47;">Test Coverage Reporting on Oracle 10g<&#47;a></p>
<p>Tim uses the data from the profiler to gather line coverage data and even puts it in a very nice report.<br />
<img src="http:&#47;&#47;timhigh.files.wordpress.com&#47;2009&#47;02&#47;report-example.png?w=450&amp;h=317" alt="Image of a code coverage report for a oracle package" &#47;></p>
<p>While beautiful in the result it is a tough way to get there with many scripts and some requirements on the code style. But its &acirc;&euro;&oelig;better than nothing&acirc;&euro;¬ù as the saying goes in northern westfalia. So my next project which requires more than trivial PL&#47;SQL code will get code coverag. Isn't that great?</p>
<p>Apparently Tim worked together with Oracle on this so there is the very slight chance that Oracle or Toad or their competition will realize that there is a difference between a GUI for easy SQL hacking and a IDE that allows controlled software development.</p>
