<p>Jurgen Appelo wrote a great Article about his new strategy to read books in a <a href="http://www.noop.nl/2009/07/reading-books-in-a-parallel-and-nonsequential-way.html">parallel and non-sequential way</a>. He uses sticky notes to mark the chapters he read in a book, thereby allowing him to read the most important unread chapter whenever he wants to read.</p>
<p>I like the concept, but it does not work for me. I read in a lot of different places and I read about 2-5 books or magazines in parallel most of the time. I do not want to carry those around all the time. In fact I read so many things in parallel because I don't want to carry the books around. Instead I try to have a book at every place where I might want to read. One in the bed room, one in the bath, one in the living room, one at the office at <a href="http://www.lineas.de">LINEAS</a> and one at the desk at the customer for the lunch breaks. And last night I had to buy a new one because I was traveling by train and hadn't a book yet for that place.</p>
<p>No matter if you are more like jurgen or more like me, or if you are one of these weird people that read one book at a time: Use Tools for Reading. At least when you are reading in order to learn something, you should use the following tools:</p>
<ol>
<li>a transparent ruler. Hold it under the current line. It will prevent you from loosing the line, and thereby enables faster reading. If a ruler is not available, a pen or a sheet of paper might work as well.</li>
<li>a pen. Put down notes. Put them on the margin of the book if you like or on post its, or on a seperate sheet of paper. Whatever, in my experience taking down notes, writing a short summary on after every chapter is the single most effective thing to prevent information to fall out of your ears, while you take it in through the eyes.</li><br />
</ol><br />
Reading is such an important thing, there really should be more discussion about how we do it. So what are your reading tips?</p>
