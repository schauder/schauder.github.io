<p>If you want to change yourself, you might be able to do it within 5 minutes. But if you want to change an organization change needs time. Even when you are the CEO, change doesn't happen because you announced it on a big meeting. But</p>
<p>If you push towards change,</p>
<p>If you don't give up,</p>
<p>If you try over and over again,</p>
<p>If you try different approaches,</p>
<p>If you talk to everyone who lets you talk,</p>
<p>someday change will happen no matter what your official title is.</p>
<p>Be persistent if the cause is worth it.</p>
