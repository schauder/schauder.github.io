  content: Thanks for the article, I recommend a central RDBMS with a schema for each
    user+project combination. We use Junit-Tests to test our java code. I use the
    username [System.getProperty("user.name")] and a project prefix to create a schema
    on the central RDBMSs and use that schema in the tests. So each developer and
    of course the build system always use an own instance. I think its not very usefull
    if every developer has its own RDBMS installed. I don't want to install, maintain
    and update a bruch of RDBMSs on my system (and not only because I use osx).

  content: "It all depends on the project setup. \r\n\r\nMultiple projects per developer,
    single schema per project and not so database savy developers push toward a central
    system.\r\n\r\nDistributed or mobile teams push toward a local database.\r\n\r\nWhatever
    works best is fine, as long as we agree that every developer has his own schema
    available."

  content: "Our team of around 6-10 devs had a schema each on a central database managed
    by the DBA.\r\n\r\nWe switched a few months ago to local Oracle Database instances.
    It took about a week for the DBA to set everyone up, but the local performance
    is now better, there is less load on our dev server, and working from home or
    on a laptop is a breeze."

    rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#47;&#47;developer.db4o.com<&#47;a>) for mocking and tests?
    (eg. <a href=\"http:&#47;&#47;community.icburner.com&#47;blogs&#47;vs2010tests&#47;archive&#47;2009&#47;06&#47;30&#47;db4o-poco-repository-using-visual-studio-2010-net-4-0-beta-1-and-asp-net-mvc-1-0.aspx\"

    They can even be kept in sync with <a href=\"http:&#47;&#47;developer.db4o.com&#47;Solutions&#47;ReplicationServices.aspx\"
    rel=\"nofollow\">dRS<&#47;a> (sync technology) which even syncs to&#47;from relational

  content: Sounds reasonable but can you recomend some version control soft to make
    this solution complete? Let say you have 5 coworkers and 3 projects - what isnt
    much - that makes 18 instances and a lot of pain keeping them up to date manually

  content: "@Krzysztof Kotlarski you wouldn't need version control if you are setting
    up the database schema using a system such as migrations in Ruby on Rails. This
    gives forward and backward movement through the history of the schema. Tie that
    in with fixtures to pre-populate the database with records and you then have ultimate
    control"

<p>How many databases run in your teams development environment? One for the complete team? I have seen many places like that, but please tell me: Why? You aren't working on a shared files system aren't you? How is a developer supposed to change the structure of that database without interrupting the work of the other developers? And just in case you haven't noticed: Pretty much every RDBMS vendor offers free versions of their database which can run on a developer machine.</p>
<p>So when you answered the second question above with 'yes' you have a task for tomorrow: Make sure every developer has her own database instance (or schema or whatever you need to work independently from the rest of the team). In addition to that: you need an instance for the automatic tests of your Continuous Integration system, one large one for performance and scalability tests, one for manual tests&#47;integration and of course one for production.</p>
<p>And just in case you are now thinking: "Hell how am I supposed to keep all these databases in sync?" You are having a gapping hole in your software development process. I'll cover that in a different post.</p>
