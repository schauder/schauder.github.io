  content: 'Good point. In fact "done" depends on the context. E.g. you definitely
    know a product is done (in the meaning of "over") when it is discontinued AND
    all installations are removed. Or when you as a coach or freelancer will never
    be back on the project or product. Or in projects: Q: "When is the project finished?"
    A: "At the point when there will be no more budget."'

<p>In our Scrum time we have a Definition of Done posted to the office wall. It's nice. It tells us when a task is done. It's not easy to achieve everything required every time. But it is possible.</p>
<p>There exists also another Definition of Done. It isn't written down anywhere. And it is completely useless:</p>
<p>"You are done with a piece of code or a feature when you won't need to touch it again"</p>
<p>It is useless, because it is impossible to achieve. Only code you delete might not change anymore. Of course there is still version control, so even that piece of code might come back.</p>
<p>Your not done when there is nothing to change. You are done when you provide some business value.</p>
