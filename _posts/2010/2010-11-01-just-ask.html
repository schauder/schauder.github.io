<p>Possibly one of the most important things a human learns is to ask questions.</p>
<p>The good news is: Every kid learns it. You can tell the parents of kids that just learned it from the blood dripping from their ears.</p>
<p>The bad news is: Almost everybody unlearns it during their time in school. So you might have to relearn it. Here is what you have to do:</p>
<p>The next time you are in a meeting or in the audience of a conference talk and don't grasp what somebody else is talking about, look around and do the following estimate:</p>
<ul>
<li>10% of the people are actually understood everything. They will be glad when somebody asks because it will show how smart they are.</li>
<li>50% are asleep anyway and don't care what is happening, as long as they can sleep a little longer.</li>
<li>40% are just as clueless as you are but haven't read this blog, so they don't dare to ask.</li>
<li>The speaker will be glad, because everybody asking a question was obviously awake during the talk, which is some kind of positive feedback.</li><br />
</ul><br />
So everybody will be better of . Tell me again, why aren't you asking your question?</p>
<p>By the way: Just last week we had a small internal conference at <a href="http://www.lineas.de">LINEAS</a> for all employees with talks by various employees. We also had <a href="http://noop.nl">Jurgen Appelo</a> as a key note speaker, and he gave his talk at the <a href="https://www.xing.com/net/pri663d64x/scrum-usergroup-braunschweig/">local scrum user group</a> the evening before as well. I am proud to say, I was kind of responsible for getting Jurgen over to Braunschweig.</p>
<p>Rumors say people where wondering "How did Jens pull that of?" Easy: I asked.</p>
