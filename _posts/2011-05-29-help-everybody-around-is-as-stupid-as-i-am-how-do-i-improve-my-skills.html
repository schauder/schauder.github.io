<p>So you are reading all these articles about Scala, TDD, Continuous Integration and so on and you are thinking: "This sure sounds cool, but how do I do it? Where do I start? Who can teach me?"</p>
<p>The easy answer is: Join the local x User Group, where x is your preferred programming language. But what to do if there is no such User Group.</p>
<p>You don't have to go to expensive trainings (although those help sometimes). In many cases all you need is a little time for research and a couple of like minded people for mutual support. Meet once a month. Do a coding Dojo. Discuss what you have learned form an article or a book. Do code reviews. Invite local bloggers for talks. Create a page in Facebook and&#47;or LinkedIn (or Xing if you are from Germany). Invite everybody remotely interested in the topic to join. Talk to the people that come to your meetings. </p>
<p>Ask companies, your employer, if they would sponsor the meetings, by providing a room and a beamer. </p>
<p>Thats it. You just started a User Group. It really isn't that difficult. And you will learn a lot on the way. About the topic of the user group, about interesting people around you and about organizing stuff.</p>
<p>If you are really interested in joining a User Group there will be one in your city. Possibly founded by yourself.</p>
