  content: "Hi Jens,\r\n\r\nyou are so right. That is perhaps painful to accept. I
    like to add:\r\n\"If you measure quality it becomes a quantity.\" - Think before
    acting!\r\n\r\nCheers"

  content: "I agree. But I would not call CC a crutch. \"Crutch\" implies sth is broken
    which usually is working and now you have to use a crutch to get the job done.
    But there is no tool which usually is working to create evolvable code. CC - so
    to speak - is the only tool we've got. It might not be the best tool, but at least
    it's here.\r\n\r\nAlso I think there is a difference between any other quality
    criteria and evovability. Any other criteria can be measured pretty easily? Is
    the performance high enough? Enough functionality? Security ok? Do you like the
    usability? etc. It might take you a day or even a week, but after that the customer
    can tell you if he's satisfied. So you can pretty easily correlate effort with
    money.\r\n\r\nThat's completely different with evolvability. When do you know
    if software is evolvable enough? And who's gonna tell you? It's not the customer
    even though a lack of evolvablity is costing him money, lots of money.\r\n\r\nSo
    you're right, clean code has no value in and of itself. But producing dirty code
    costs tons of money, And as long as you can't tell how much, you better assume
    it's more than you like.\r\n\r\nI perfectly well understand customers not understanding
    why refactoring is need, why they should pay for it. \"Why do you have to stop
    delivering value to me for a week or two? Because you have to clean up some internal
    mess in your software?\"\r\n\r\nTo avoid such embarrasing situation you better
    produce clean code from day one on or better even follow Clean Code Developer
    principles and practices (which are richer than just CC). This does not mean you
    never need to refactor anything. It just promises the refactorings won't grow
    so big as to become noticeable for the customer."

  content: "But clean code is not a substantive - i think that's what Jens wanted
    to say ... but I suppose that clean code should be the only code written ;) -
    we have to stop those dudes who just glue their changes in action performed methods
    again and again... only because that was in that moment the cheapest&#47;fastest
    solution ... because this would only be the fastest solution for them...\r\n\r\nabout
    a minute ago I had to fix such crap! *narf*"

  content: "I find arguing (with non-believers) on the need for \"clean code\" as
    well extremely difficult and frustrating for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n- a
    typical project manager cares only about his next release, so even the argument
    of \"clean code makes us faster&#47;cheaper in the future\" is rather seldom very
    successful\r\n- the efficiency gains due to clean code are extremely hard to quantify
    \r\n- the end user does not care directly neither\r\n\r\nSo I could just \"do
    it for myself as you proposed\", but convincing my environment is the harder part"

  content: "I disagree slightly - clean code can have an intrinsic value to a developer,
    but value is subjective, it has little value to a customer who (usually) doesn't
    care about code quality, they just want working software.\r\n\r\nIn my day to
    day work as a developer I find clean code to be of higher value to me, I would
    rather work with clean code so I make the effort to create clean code because
    it has value to me. If it didn't why would I bother.\r\n\r\nI make the case to
    my project manager that clean code has value to them as it makes it easier for
    us to deliver working code and changes more quickly and it enables us to be more
    certain that the code does what is required - I even sometimes manage to convince
    him to sell spending longer cleaning up legacy code to the customer with reasons
    along  those lines.\r\n\r\nSo, clean code has value to some people, it just doesn't
    have any direct value to the customer (who lets face it wouldn't care if you wrote
    everything in COBOL if it did what they wanted).\r\n\r\n(This is all predicated
    that the code does what the customer wants - clean code which does the wrong thing
    or has no use does have no value)."

<p>A last week I was at the completely awesome <a href="http:&#47;&#47;socrates2011.pbworks.com&#47;w&#47;page&#47;36608238&#47;SoCraTes%202011">SoCraTes conference<&#47;a>. It was the first meeting of the German Software Craftsmanship Community. Some of the attendees argued that some day in the future there might be a way to measure the quality of software which in turn would help to argue with management about the need for refactoring and similar actions. I strongly disagree. What amounts to quality in one environment is a lack of quality or even a bug in another environment. So there can't be a single metric.</p>
<p>Apart from being utopian the idea of a single quality measurement might actually hide a dangerous attitude: The attitude that clean code has a value on its own! It doesn't. Even if you don't like it: The only things that count in the end are measured in dollars, euro and yen. </p>
<p>In this sense clean code is only a crutch. We do it in order to get somewhere where we can't go without, or at least not as easy. </p>
<p>We are convinced that improving our code, and writing tests </p>
<ul>
<li>
makes us faster (and therefore our work cheaper) in the not to long run.<br />
<&#47;li>
<li>
makes the code easier to maintain.<br />
<&#47;li>
<li>
makes it easier to add features tomorrow.<br />
<&#47;li><&#47;ul></p>
<p>And as long as I'm convinced it is helping with these aims I'll continue to do so, and so should you.</p>
<p>But if your are doing it just because it is in some fuzzy sense the 'right thing to do' you are doing it for the wrong reason and you might be doing the wrong thing.</p>
