    its interface\" - I cannot see what you mean there."

  content: "Hi Andreas,\r\njust as most other classes a Singleton should implement
    an interface. And clients using the singleton should not depend on the singleton
    itself, but on the interface."

  content: So you mean injecting <em>the instance<&#47;em>? - Then you have the classic
    Spring&#47;EJB&#47;etc idea. Define a "Bean" and inject it. Then the Bean is the
    singleton, right?

  content: "Yes this is basically correct.\r\n\r\nActually I personally distinguish
    between the pattern 'Singleton', i.e. a class that can only create a single instance,
    and the usage of the class, which shouldn't care if it is a singleton and might
    use classes which aren't a singleton as if they are one."

  content: Hm - i don't see why wee need an interface here? Of course one should implement
    against interfaces, but personally I prefer having interfaces if I need them,
    i.e. if I have more then one interpretation of a type. If I have a class with
    typical functionality, I don't need an interface for a better design. I would
    use "introduce interface" refactoring right at the time I have a second class
    doing well unter the same type. I don't like those projects where you have all
    those interfaces around without any reason for them. These interfaces are mostly
    created because in early days some teacher told us to always use interfaces ;)

  content: "You are correct. The interface (in the java sense) isn't strictly necessary.
    In the generic sense of a contract which is independent of the implementation
    is necessary though. \r\n\r\nI'm thinking that when you are referencing the implementation
    directly it is to tempting to access the instance directly instead of through
    dependency injection. \r\n\r\nBut I might be wrong about that."

<p>When you ask people who know almost, but not completely nothing about patterns, about software design patterns, they probably bring up the singleton pattern. It's extremely easy: Just make sure you have one single instance of a class.</p>
<p>If you ask more experienced developers about the singleton, they will probably tell you its bad and should be avoided.</p>
<p>What is so bad about the singleton that it fell from the heavon of patterns into the hell of anti patterns?</p>
<p>If you check the description of the singleton pattern in the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.amazon.de&#47;gp&#47;product&#47;0201633612?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=schauderhafte-21&amp;linkCode=shr&amp;camp=3206&amp;creative=21426&amp;creativeASIN=0201633612&amp;ref_=sr_1_1&amp;qid=1326657640&amp;sr=8-1">Gang of Four book<&#47;a> it talks about two characteristics of the singleton:</p>
<ul>
<li>There can be only&Acirc;&nbsp; a single instance<&#47;li>
<li>There is a central access point to that instance<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul><br />
And there really is nothing wrong about the first point. Sometimes you really can't have more then one instance, but even if multiple instances don't hurt, if they don't give you any benefit (i.e. if they are stateless) you might as well reuse a single instance.</p>
<p>The problem is really with the central access point. This makes the singleton look and behave like a global variable. And how should we obtain our dependencies? Correct through Dependency injection.</p>
<p>So the next time you think: "Looks like a singleton to me". Go ahead, create a singleton. But also create an interface which gets implemented by the singleton and make it very clear that nobody may use this singleton except via its interface and <a href="&#47;2012&#47;01&#47;01&#47;the-one-correct-way-to-do-dependency-injection&#47;">dependency injection through constructor<&#47;a>.</p>
