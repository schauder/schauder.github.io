  content: "There are others agreeing at least in principal with me. And of course
    there is lots of work done I don't know about (yet).\r\n\r\nIf you care at all
    about software development and evidence, go watch this talk: <h ref=\"http:&#47;&#47;vimeo.com&#47;9270320\">Greg
    Wilson - What We Actually Know About Software Development, and Why We Believe
    It's True<&#47;h>.\r\n\r\nIts great, but be warned, it resulted in three more
    books on my wish list."

    to dismiss his multi decade long advice.\r\n\r\nI'm thinking Uncle Bob is just
    fed up trying to talk policitally correct about his experience because people
    will complain anyway. If you just think about it then those heretics you mention
    never ever back their claims up while Uncle Bob does. So why lump him in the same
    religious and thus irrelevant category?\r\n\r\nKnowing which of the 2 is talking
    nonsense might be something we should finally figure out."

  content: "The biggest problem is that programmers hardly ever refer to computer
    science papers. The ones that do work in research departments at universities
    or in research labs at places like IBM, Microsoft and Google.\r\n\r\nWhile in
    university, no one is encouraged to start researching and to look for journals
    and articles that will better explain an idea. When at work, employers don't pay
    for subscriptions to journals or employees don't demand subscriptions.\r\n\r\nAnalysis
    of project stats such as defect rate and lines of code, etc. has been done, but
    the research isn't finding its way into everyone's hands because we expect any
    articles referenced to be free or at least very easy to get. We're very used to
    the Web and we've forgotten or haven't learned how to do solid research."

  content: "Speaking of Greg Wilson's speech, I just picked up a copy of <em>Making
    Software<&#47;em> and read the first article (chapter?), \"The Quest for Convincing
    Evidence\" by Tim Menzies and Forrest Shull. And then I became very sad.\r\n\r\nTo
    loosely summarize the chapter, we started out wanting good evidence: elegance,
    statistical strength, and replicability. But those are hard and no one is really
    interested in doing <em>that<&#47;em> work; coming up with new techniques is easier
    and more fun. So now, we're looking for \"convincing evidence [that] <em>motivates
    change<&#47;em>\" [Yes, their emphasis]. Going forward, we have hundreds of millions
    of nifty techniques that might or might not have worked for one project, anyway.
    We have no idea what really works or why, and no real interest in doing the work
    to find out. What we do have, and in spades, is detailed knowledge of how to convince
    people to buy into <em>your<&#47;em> nifty new idea."

  content: 'Software development is no different than medicine!!!! Computer science
    and medical science are both an oxymoron. For medicine to become a science, the
    discipline needs to be able to handle the combination and permutations of a few
    billion factors predicting an outcome with 99.99% confidence. This won''t happen
    in the next few hundred years. Computer science has the same problem. No one can
    write requirements for a program to cover all of the eventual possibilities that
    the program will encounter. If they wrote the requirements, probably a 1 billion
    page document, no programmer could read it in their life time! much less implement
    it in their life time. Face it. Computer science, computer programming are arts.
    The difference between the best and the worst is the difference between a 3 year
    old crayon drawing and Michelangelo - a factor of thousands. Medicine is thousands
    of years old as a discipline. Computer science is 60 years old! Anyone who thinks
    that they can turn computer programming into a skilled labor job is clearly ignorant.
    And the funny thing is that some smart people can''t program a computer because
    they can''t deal with the failure legs!  These are the people who can create a
    super algorithm and implement it. But if the data falls just a little off of the
    expectation, the resultant program is garbage.  Like medicine it is illogical
    to try to make computer programming a definitive science. Think about it this
    way: write a medical diagnostic program.  Guess what? The requirements are shaky,
    imperfect, questionable, wrong, ..... what will the program be?'

  content: Have you even looked into the IEEE Software Engineering Body of Knowledge
    (SWEBOK)? I would highly recommend it if you think there isn't a solid set of
    well-researched and agreed upon data about what works. Software development is
    always evolving. Languages are changing. Platforms are changing. Chips are changing.
    All of these changes introduce new possibilities, new room for new techniques.
    Coming up with general step-by-step principles in an environment constantly in
    flux is not going to be made any easier by throwing more data at the problem.
    It's too big and varied for the Grand Unified Theory approach.

    It contains a number of useful research papers on the topic.\r\n\r\nYou are mistaken
    in saying that the state of the art for software development practice is like
    medieval cathedral building. The problem is that software engineering, unlike
    every other engineering field, has a much wider gulf between best practices and
    common practice."

  content: "Hi everybody,\r\nthanks for the valuable feedback, and sorry for answering
    so late, somehow notification of new comments didn't reach my inbox :-&#47;\r\n\r\nThere
    are some things comming up in the comments here and over at <a href=\"http:&#47;&#47;www.reddit.com&#47;r&#47;programming&#47;comments&#47;q2ihh&#47;where_is_the_science_in_software_development&#47;\"
    rel=\"nofollow\">reddit<&#47;a>\r\n\r\nI'll try to answer on some:\r\n\r\n1. I
    never said Uncle Bob is irrelevant or wrong. I'm wearing his green wrist band
    with pride and agree with most what he says. I also like his not PC way of saying
    it. What I'm saying is: most of the time he doesn't even hint an proof of what
    he says. Same is true for most people, e.g. Fowler and me (which doesn't mean
    I want to compare me to Uncle Bob or Martin Fowler)\r\n\r\n2. The book <a href=\"http:&#47;&#47;www.amazon.de&#47;gp&#47;product&#47;B004D4YI6G?ie=UTF8&tag=schauderhafte-21&linkCode=shr&camp=3206&creative=21426&creativeASIN=B004D4YI6G&ref_=sr_1_2&qid=1330248880&sr=8-2\"
    rel=\"nofollow\">Making Software published by O&acirc;&euro;&trade;Reilly<&#47;a>\r\nI'm
    reading it just now. Yes it is a little depressing at places. But it also makes
    the results of scientific results about software development accessible to non
    scientists. Very important. A must read.\r\n\r\n3. The SWEBOK \r\nI know about
    it. But I must say I find its use quite limited. Its merely a big dictionary to
    the research work, that has been done. Its very hard to extract actually valuable
    information about it. Also I didn't say that there is no research being done.
    I tried to make the point, that we could have lots of data to do research with.\r\n\r\n4.
    Software Development is a craft&#47;art, there is no science\r\nWhile the first
    part might be correct, the second part is just wrong. Artists and craftman use
    the results of science all the time. Do you really think masons and architects
    estimate how thick they have to make a roof? No they have rules, which are based
    on physics and other sciences.\r\n\r\nJust because requirements and programming
    languages change there is no reason we can't know if or when pair programming
    or TDD works."

    of the links in this article are old but you can still find them.\r\n\r\nWe need
    to run \"controlled\" experiments like this on the various approaches to developing
    software to see which ones work on which kinds of projects.\r\n\r\nMedicine has
    clinical trials to determine if new drugs and new medical procedures work.  Doctors
    and scientists have developed protocols to assure that the outcomes of these trials
    are meaningful instead of reflecting  an artifact of the trial itself.  We will
    need to develop some reliable protocols for software development experiments so
    the results are reliable.\r\n\r\nAnother source we could learn from is the Underwriters
    Laboratories.  They develop tests for all kinds of devices to assure safety and
    reliability.  We need the software development equivalent to the Underwriters
    Laboratories."

<p>Lots of stuff in software development has some really solid scientic foundation. Relational databases for example are based on <a href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Relational_algebra">Relational Algebra<&#47;a>. There is <a href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Lambda_calculus">Lambda Calculus<&#47;a> and <a href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Type_theory">Type Theory<&#47;a>.</p>
<p>And at least in my personal opionion and experience these kind of things work especially well. Yet when it comes to the construction of code the whole thing does look more like a religion. High priest Uncle Bob preaches that shorter is better and that only those developers will reach nirvana that write their tests before the production code.</p>
<p>And than there are the heretics that call all this bull shit, never write a single test but methods as <a href="http:&#47;&#47;vimeo.com&#47;9981123">long as the Edda<&#47;a>. And lets not forget: those guys ship code as well.</p>
<p>If you check the scientific facts behind any advice of how to write code you are bound to find a void as empty as the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Outer_space#Interstellar">space behind Pluto<&#47;a> or a reference to some research done 30 years ago with 20 students doing a 4 hour assignement using different styles, languages or what ever. Correlation to my daily work? Approximately zero. Its like the scientific fact that a feather and a hammer should drop with the same acceleration and hence speed. True if you happen live in a vacuum tube, but pretty irrelevant in this form for our daily life.</p>
<p>I'm wondering why is this? It really doesn't have to be that way. We all use an IDE which already contains lots of plugins. Our builds, including our test runs are automated. The source code is in a version control system. We track our bugs in an issue tracking system, and with a little effort we can link every commit to a bug (or a feature) in our issue tracking system.</p>
<p>Why don't we have a set of plug ins that gathers various pieces of information about our code development efforts in a central public repository? I imagine such a repository would be enormously valuable for research.</p>
<p>Of course the data wouldn't be perfect but go talk to biologists, archeologists, economists or any other scientists, with the possible exception of computer scientists, mathmaticians and theoretic physicists: Data is never perfect.</p>
<p>Right now&Acirc;&nbsp; software development is like building cathedrals in mediaval times. Looks impressive as long as it stays up, but nobody can tell if it will stay up without trying.</p>
<p>Its about time we get serious about software development. What is stopping us? Or is this already happening and I just missed it?</p>
