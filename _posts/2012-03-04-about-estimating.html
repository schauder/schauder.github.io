  content: "I had some trouble initially agreeing with point 1, I think I get what
    you mean: estimates != product ready for use.  Please correct me if this is wrong.\r\n\r\nEngineers
    should be able to commit to deliver whatever they have agreed to  in the time
    frame they have agreed to.  However it is usual that the definition of done is
    different for engineers&#47;management&#47;customers.\r\n\r\nIf the management
    does not have a grip on the software process or realities then you may need to
    factor in time for \"done done\" yourself."

  content: "@Andy What I'm trying to say is a little different.\r\n\r\nWhat people
    estimate is basically a median, i.e. if you have good estimators you can expect
    in one half of the cases to finish before the estimated time and one half after
    the estimated time. \r\n\r\nThis is not something you base a promise or commitment
    on. For a commitment you want something like a 80, 90 or 9x percentile. This is
    not what you get when you ask for an estimate."

    then no software projects will ever commence.\r\n\r\nMaybe there is a case for
    a new kind of contract where very pessimistic estimates will be given for everything
    but the customer will share in the profits if the software comes in early.\r\n\r\nIf
    that was to work then the software company would need to be very open to customers
    about hours spent and probably on history of other projects too.  This would be
    a good thing for both parties I think."

  content: "Of course you can get more the 50% confidence. But that is not the estimate.
    If you ask someone to ESTIMATE you will get a median of the actual effort needed.\r\n\r\nIf
    you turn around, multiply with your hourly rate and make that the price & release
    date (i.e. you make them promises&#47;commitment) you ask for trouble.\r\n\r\nI'll
    try an example: My son might call me at work and as me when I will come home.
    I'll think for a moment about the stuff I have to do today and give an estimate:
    Probably at 5pm. (That is an honest estimate). \r\nHe'll do what managers tend
    to do: \"Oh great so you can take me to chess training. We'll have to leave at
    5pm\"\r\n\r\nAnd I will stop him: While I might be home at 5 pm an it is actually
    a good estimate, I can't promise it. I might be able to promise 5:30 or 6pm. \r\n\r\nIts
    ok for a 7year old to make the mistake, but not for a manager. Managers don't
    have dads hanging around stopping them from making such stupid mistakes."

    would prefer, in effect to put the whole responsibility of the project on the
    heads of the software writers instead of planning for actual success.\r\n\r\nGood

<p>One of the most difficult tasks in software development is estimating also known as guessing. Here are a couple of thoughts about the topic.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Estimates aren't Commitments<&#47;strong>. At least they shouldn't. Lets assume you estimate you need 1 hour from your home to the airport, through all formalities and into the plane. Do you leave your house 1 hour before departure of the plane? Probably not. You'll add all kinds of buffers and leave your house a lot earlier. Same should apply to any kind of project. If you think it takes 6 months it is a bad idea to promise a delivery date in 6 months. Promise 7, 9 or 12 months, depending how bad it is when you show up late.<&#47;li>
<li><strong>Estimates aren't measurments<&#47;strong>. If you want to build a shelf, you can measure the space you have available, and if you measure properly you can cut the boards according to that measurement and they will fit. If they don't it is probably your fault because you didn't measure properly. With the tools in your house you might be able to measure size up to a couple meters with an error of about 1&#47;1000 and if you want to measure more precise you just have to invest in better tools and measure more carefully.Not so with software. If you estimate a task to take a day you might be done after a day. Or maybe after 6 hours. Or you give up after 3 days. There is no way to be sure. You can't just put more effort in estimating to make it more precise. Tools won't help you much. The only thing reducing the margin of error is actually implementing it.<&#47;li>
<li><strong>Some basics in statistics<&#47;strong>. If you roll a dice once you will score approximately 3.5 points. With a margin of error of about 100%. If you roll the dice 1 million times the average value will be 3.5 with pretty good precision. This is no accident, but pretty strong math. The basic idea is that you can add up indipendent random events and that the relative uncertainty is smaller for the added up events than for each single event. This is good news since if you estimate a project you typically break it down into tasks and estimate each task. Then you add up everything and get your result. Which has a smaller range of error.<&#47;li>
<li><strong>The rule above applies does not apply<&#47;strong>. It holds only when the events (guesses&#47;estimates) follow a normal distribution and are independent of each other. Neither is true for software estimates. Go figure.<&#47;li>
<li><strong>We learn through feedback<&#47;strong><br />
It's almost impossible to learn anything without getting feedback on how you are doing. Imagine learning chess without anybody ever telling you when you make a bad or even illegal move. You just have a book with the rules and play games against yourself. How likely do you think it is to ever become a respectable chess player? Nil? I think so too. But with estimating we are often in such a situation. When you do waterfall projects you often do estimates for 100s of tasks in one go and only a year later you get the feedback: The sum of your estimates was 20% of. It's really hard to learn this way. The situation improves a lot when you follow agile practices, where you typically estimate smaller batches, closer to the time when they are actually performed. This enables you to actually learn how long tasks take.<&#47;li><br />
