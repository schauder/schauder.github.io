  content: Hi, totally agree with you and have been doing the same for about a year
    now and while it certainly hurt my head trying to structure code around these
    principals it really has produced some much cleaner applications and easier to
    extend and maintain... I only wish I could refactor all the "legacy" projects
    I have to work with that use packages to group class types, e.g. controllers,
    daos, etc.

  content: "Agreed. However, I won't go as far as restricting package size. The biggest
    packaging failure I've currently seen is not that packages become too big, but
    rather that packages are desigend as modules:\r\nSo many projects tend to create
    packages like \"exceptions\", \"yxz\", just piling up structures of a certain
    kind, as if a package is simply a sorting container. These projects tend to create
    A LOT of small packages by the way.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, there are packages
    like com.google.collect which are extremely big, but for a reason: To use the
    package-private visibility. The package scope is completely underrated in java:
    It allows to lessen the private restrictions for tests and (rare) internal optimizations
    while its still a closed scope for everyone else. Much like friends in C++.\r\n\r\nMy
    guideline for packages in non-api projects is like this: I tend to start out with
    large dump-packages with a lot of package only-classes, so that the package-api
    to the outer world stays small. After a while, when the package intention becomes
    clearer, I tend to refactor it into smaller units. That has served my quite well
    for now."

    Hi Eric,
    I agree with the antipattern you describe. A package should have purpose and should contain classes to fulfill that purpose. A package just gathering stuff of the same kind is a mistake.

    About limiting the package size: The rule alone will not lead to a better package structure, but combined with instruction on how to structure package it will act as a reminder for the team, to keep the structure clean.

<p>I hope we all agree that methods an classes should be small and have only few dependencies. This point of view is widely accepted, while the interpretation of "small" varies. There is lots of literature out there about this. But what about packages?</p>
<p>Some people consider packages just as namespaces. So packages are just things that allow you to reuse names for classes!?</p>
<p>I thought so about methods a couple of years ago: Just containers for reusable code.</p>
<p>Today I disagree with both statements. Methods are a very important tool to name a thing, to separate it from the rest, even when it is called only once.</p>
<p>Likewise packages have an important role even when we ignore the issue of names. Packages bundle together some functionality. They name that functionality and they should encapsulate it so we might reuse it. And just as with methods a package should have single purpose. It is probably a 'bigger' purpose than that of a method but still it should do only stuff directly related to that purpose.</p>
<p>Unfortunately in many projects this doesn't work out well.</p>
<p>Here is a challenge. Pick a random package out of your current project. For this package answer the following questions</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the purpose of that package? Please use a single simple sentence. Does this sentence match the name of the package?<&#47;li>
<li>Go through the classes of that package do they all work together to achieve the purpose of the class? Or are there classes in there that just ended up there by accident?<&#47;li>
<li>Go through all the other classes of your system. Is none of them concerned with the single purpose of your package? Or are there classes that float around somewhere else that really should be in the package you are looking at?<&#47;li>
<li>If your coworker in the next project needs basically the same package, how difficult would it be to extract the package from your code base and build it as a standalone jar?<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul><br />
In my experience it is very likely that the answers to the questions above are rather depressing. They certainly are in most projects I worked with.</p>
<p>Even when the classes and methods in that project are reasonable clean.</p>
<p>Why is that?</p>
<p>I think the reason is that problems with packages are not as obvious as with methods or classes. If a methods spans across the complete monitor you see that every time all the time you are working with the method. And since the method is long there is probably much work to be done in it. Same for classes. But with packages is different. I spend whole days coding without looking what is inside a package . I open my classes with shortcuts and name based search, no need to look inside packages.</p>
<p>So you won't notice that classes concerned with completely different issues are together in one package. You won't notice that the number of classes in a package exceeds any reasonable threshold.</p>
<p>And if it comes to the last question, the question about dependencies it becomes really ugly. What other packages does a package depend on? Which class contains that dependency? There is very limited tool support for this kind of question. And the question only gets asked late in a project, maybe when a sister project gets spawned that should reuse some of the code base so it should move in a common base project.</p>
<p>Since I have been there a couple of times I recommend to implement a couple of tests right in the beginning of a project using either JDepend or Dependency Finder:</p>
<ul>
<li>No cyclic dependencies between packages<&#47;li>
<li>A maximum number of classes per package<&#47;li>
<li>A fixed naming schema like &Acirc;&nbsp;<domain>.
<project>.<module>.<layer>.<rest-of-package-name><&#47;li></p>
<li>A fixed direction of dependencies between modules (modules are vertical slices, often based on some domain concept)<&#47;li>
<li>A fixed direction of dependencies between layers ( gui, presentation, domain, persistence are typical examples)<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul><br />
But be warned: these tests tend to be hard to keep satisfied. But if you put in the extra effort to keep your packages clean it has a significant positive impact on your application structure.</p>
