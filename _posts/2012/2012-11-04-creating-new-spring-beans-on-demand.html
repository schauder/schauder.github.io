<p>We lately had a little Spring related challenge in our application at work. We had a singleton bean (<tt>TheClient</tt>) that on every call of a method needed a group of other beans. These beans (<tt>TheService</tt>) unfortunately where stateful and couldn't be reused on the next call. So they had to be recreated every time.</p>
<p>Not a big deal we thought at first, nothing forces us to use Spring, so we just created the bean using ... drum roll ... <strong>new</strong>.</p>
<p>This works fine until you need something from your Spring context. Maybe another bean or something provided via AOP. Of course you can make your bean  <a href="http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/3.1.x/javadoc-api/org/springframework/context/ApplicationContextAware.html">ApplicationContextAware</a> and look it up using the <a href="http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/3.1.x/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/BeanFactory.html#getBean(java.lang.String)">getBean method on the ApplicationContext</a>.</p>
<p>But this really negates the idea of dependency injection and typically is a sign something is messed up. But how to do it properly? I was a little surprised that my google searches didn't turn up anything useful. So I brought my question to the place where every IT question belongs these days: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">Stackoverflow</a>. Sure enough <a href="https://plus.google.com/111266412943874700770">Oliver Gierke</a>, whom I know from him talking at our <a href="http://www.jug-ostfalen.de">local java user group</a> <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/13026344/66686">pointed me to the solution</a>.</p>
<p><tt>TheClient</tt> provides an abstract method returning the required bean:</p>
<pre lang="java" >
    public abstract TheService createService()<br />
</pre></p>
<p>If configured correctly Spring will provide the implementation for the method.</p>
<pre lang="xml" >
    <bean id="theService" class="TheService" scope="prototype" /></p>
<p>    <bean class="TheClient"><br />
        <lookup-method name="createService" bean="theService" /><br />
    </bean><br />
</pre></p>
<p>Now you can call <tt>createService</tt> any time you need a fresh Spring managed instance of <tt>TheService</tt></p>
