Lately people keep telling me that things that are common practice in agile projects are done in watafall
based processes as well. And you know what? Some are. But others aren't and again others are completely missing.
So thougt lets make a small series of article about waterfall artifacts and practices compared
to matching agile artifacts and practices.

My view on classical projectmanagement stemms from my IPMA certification from 2004. So it is theoretical, a little old
but in many cases it seems better grounded then that of some project managers. 

My view on agile practices stems from my last 10 years of software development in teams that
tried to be agile and succeeded in various degrees.

Of course you are welcome to disagree, either in your own blog or down in the comments.
