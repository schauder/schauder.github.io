Last week I produced a new release of [Degraph](http://schauder.github.io/degraph/download.html)! Yeah. Unfortunatly I did not 
fix [the most pressing issue](https://github.com/schauder/degraph/issues/61):
You still can't filter dependencies that you know are causing violations. :-/

But on the good side: The reason for having a release was to have a very specific method, that
someone needed to create a little Degraph Gradle plugin! So we might get one in the not to far
future, or at least an example how to create a Gradle script for executing Degraph Tests!

Also the new version contains some simple performance improvements, so go and get it. 
And let me know if you experience any problems.
