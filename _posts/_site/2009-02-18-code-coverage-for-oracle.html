<p>I try to minimize the use of database specific programming languages like PL&#47;SQL. It is just annoying to work with a language that is just badly designed and has hardly any serious tool support. It (and the IDEs around it) is lacking in so many ways. All the things I would expect from the most basic development environment are missing.</p>
<p>Yet sometimes we can&acirc;&euro;&trade;t help it and just have to use PL&#47;SQL for performance or political reasons, but it really hurts.<br />
And the frustrating part: Nobody seems to care.</p>
<p>Nobody? There are a few guys working on these things. I wrote <a href="&#47;2008&#47;12&#47;19&#47;news-on-testing-for-databases&#47;">about Tim High<&#47;a> before. Yesterday he left a <a href="&#47;2008&#47;12&#47;19&#47;news-on-testing-for-databases&#47;#comment-136">comment<&#47;a> on the post to inform me that he wrote another article that might interest me. Completely superfluous. I already picked it up on DZone and marked it for future reference in my blog. So here it is:</p>
<p><a href="http:&#47;&#47;timhigh.wordpress.com&#47;2009&#47;02&#47;17&#47;test-coverage-reporting-on-oracle-10g&#47;trackback&#47;">Test Coverage Reporting on Oracle 10g<&#47;a></p>
<p>Tim uses the data from the profiler to gather line coverage data and even puts it in a very nice report.<br />

<p>While beautiful in the result it is a tough way to get there with many scripts and some requirements on the code style. But its &acirc;&euro;&oelig;better than nothing&acirc;&euro;¬ù as the saying goes in northern westfalia. So my next project which requires more than trivial PL&#47;SQL code will get code coverag. Isn't that great?</p>
<p>Apparently Tim worked together with Oracle on this so there is the very slight chance that Oracle or Toad or their competition will realize that there is a difference between a GUI for easy SQL hacking and a IDE that allows controlled software development.</p>
