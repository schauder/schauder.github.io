<p>I am a big <a href="&#47;2008&#47;11&#47;27&#47;why-hibernate-is-so-much-more-powerful-than-jdbc&#47;">fan of creating at least the basic structure of your database from the domain model using hibernate<&#47;a>. But if you work with <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.oracle.com">Oracle<&#47;a> you know on problem with this approach: the length of names is seriously limited for tables and columns. So if you have a&Acirc;&nbsp; inner class with embeddables you pretty soon bump against that limit of 30 characters.</p>
<p>I published before an <a href="&#47;2008&#47;02&#47;22&#47;hibernate-namingstrategy-fur-oracle&#47;">OracleNamingStrategy<&#47;a> that fixes this problem by creating abbreviations on this blog. But writing a <a href="&#47;2008&#47;03&#47;29&#47;hibernate-naming-strategie-fur-oracle-die-zweite&#47;">new blog entry<&#47;a> with all the code every time I find a little glitch in the code felt just wrong. So I published it as an official Open Source Project over at <a href="http:&#47;&#47;code.google.com&#47;">google code<&#47;a>: <a href="http:&#47;&#47;code.google.com&#47;p&#47;hibernate-naming-strategy-for-oracle&#47;">The Hibernate Naming Strategy for Oracle!<&#47;a> And I just released the first version. and since it is so extremely simple, it isn't even a jar but a <a href="http:&#47;&#47;code.google.com&#47;p&#47;hibernate-naming-strategy-for-oracle&#47;downloads&#47;list">single java file<&#47;a>.</p>
<p>I'd be glad if this is of some use for other developers. If you like it, drop me a line in the comments. If you find a bug or have an idea for improvement use the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;code.google.com&#47;p&#47;hibernate-naming-strategy-for-oracle&#47;issues&#47;list">issue tracker<&#47;a>.</p>
