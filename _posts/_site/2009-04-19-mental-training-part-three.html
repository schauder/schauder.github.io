<p>This is the third part in my little series of <a href="&#47;2009&#47;04&#47;08&#47;mental-training-part-one&#47;">training tips<&#47;a> for <a href="&#47;2009&#47;04&#47;14&#47;mental-training-part-two&#47;">your brain<&#47;a>. I call this one:</p>
<p><strong>Where is the missing link?<&#47;strong></p>
<p>Pick any two things, events or persons. For example the person working at the local bakery and the cestial body formerly known as 'planet pluto'. What is the connection between those two? Can you come up with a short story or scene, where both play an important role. Or a comparison? "His rolls are as cold as the surface of pluto." Or does he travel to pluto to concur with some aliens in order to exchange recipies? This of course would explain his long vacations.</p>
<p>It will train your creativity for sure. I am convinced that creativity is a skill that needs training just as every other skill as well.</p>
