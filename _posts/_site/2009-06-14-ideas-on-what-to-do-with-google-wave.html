<p>Everybody is <a href="http:&#47;&#47;twitter.com&#47;#search?q=google%20wave">talking<&#47;a> about Google Wave and it sure is interesting stuff they are <a href="http:&#47;&#47;wave.google.com&#47;">showing<&#47;a>. I was considering getting a sandbox account, but I currently don't have the time to use it. So here are my ideas about what you could do with Google Wave:</p>
<p>- Collaborative mind mapping tool (Gadget). Edit Mindmaps with multiple persons.</p>
<p>- Collaborative graphic tool (Gadget). Edit graphics and diagrams with multiple persons. Especially UML like diagrams. Could be a cool replacement for a whiteboard for people to far apart to use a real one, or to lazy to stand up.</p>
<p>- Tempest, the brainstorming robot (Robot).&Acirc;&nbsp; When you select a word or words, Tempest would create a list of related words. As a first try it would check wikipedia, if a matching article exist, use referenced or referencing articles as words to propose. It also could use Google Squared, Google Set, the attributes found by Wolfram|Alpha and many other sources.</p>
<p>- Notes Linky (Robot): This one is similar to Tempest, but would check your notes on google notes and provide Links to it from your Wave.</p>
<p>- CoCode: a IDE plugin to do pair programming, while on different machines</p>
<p>What are your ideas for usage of Google Wave?</p>
