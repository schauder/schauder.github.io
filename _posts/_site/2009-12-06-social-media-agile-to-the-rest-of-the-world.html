<p>For about a decade now everybody in IT talks about Agile, but hardly anybody else does. There is a somewhat similar concept of 'Lean' in other industries, but hardly anybody in a 'real' industry considers things like 'release early' a viable strategy. And that's a good thing. I don't want a second iteration car. "Ooops sorry, the story about braking is still in the backlog". I am confident that if those kind of companies would learn agile from the books, they'd need quite some time until they realize the fine difference between 'ship' and 'shippable'.</p>
<p>But maybe these companies won't learn it from the books, but from their tools. As <a href="&#47;2009&#47;11&#47;15&#47;social_web_tool_fool&#47;">said before<&#47;a> companies will learn about social media, and to some extend it will invade&Acirc;&nbsp; daily life and work at these companies. But if you start doing your documentation in a wiki, for everybody to see or spurt out your idea on a internal twitter account, then you are presenting stuff as potentially shippable. Not the car you will eventually build. But maybe the concept for a new feature.</p>
<p>Everybody will be able to judge the results, comment, provide feedback. And without realizing it big old companies will become just a little bit agile.</p>
