<p>Agile Methods teach us that if something doesn't work when we do it only once in a project, we should consider doing it all the time. This seems to work for testing, estimating, releasing, integrating and many more. So, why exactly should this approach be limited to software development?</p>
<p>I hereby present the successor of Democracy: Continuous Democracy</p>
<p>After all democracy in many states has the problem that elections get more and more unattractive for voters. I assume this is at least to some extend due to the feeling that a) politicians change their mind about their plans in the moment the ballot closes, b) you only get one vote, but there are many things to decide on.</p>
<p>Some states like Switzerland solve the second problem by having a ballot for all kinds of things resulting in lots of votes, but possibly even higher frustration on the side of the voters.</p>
<p>With Continuous Democracy this would be a little different: Every voter could change her mind any time, and change her vote on a website. So the number of votes a party has in parliament would change every hour. If politicians do something stupid, they'll notice it within a day. At the same time it would much harder for politicians with extreme opinions to win a ballot just because the majority was to lazy to vote.</p>
<p>The scheme probably needs some tuning to ensure that one gets a more or less stable government, but I consider that minor problems.</p>
