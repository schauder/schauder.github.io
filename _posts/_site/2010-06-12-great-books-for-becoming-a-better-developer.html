Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software:<&#47;a> This is the standard book on patterns and patterns are an extremely important piece of vocabulary for every developer. Not to impress coworkers with your knowledge, but to be able to think about bigger concepts than loops and conditionals. It describes each pattern with its purpose, it's applicability and an example. Make sure to read a couple of blog posts about each pattern, to make sure you avoid some of the more common mistakes when applying them.</p>

You want to be able to go back to your code in a year without swearing? This is the book for you. The author Robert C. Martin (also known as Uncle Bob) is extremely aggressive on what he is accepting as clean. This book really changed the way I look at code, and of course the way I write code. Make sure to really understand the lengthy examples. It is tedious, but it pays.</p>
