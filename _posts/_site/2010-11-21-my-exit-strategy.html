<p>The last months have been extremely busy. Three different projects causing lots of work and sometimes worries, three different conferences I attended as a speaker and various talks at the local JUG. This made it hard to actually think about what I want to do next year. Now all the busy stuff is over (although somebody mentioned some kind of holiday coming up). So I made up my mind, what I want to do in the next year:</p>
<ul>
<li>I want to as much Scala development as possible. I really like that language and it offers tons of inspirations while still allowing me to build on my Java experience.<&#47;li>
<li>I want to learn a little Clojure. Just because I like making knots in my brain.<&#47;li>
<li>I will do some web development. My skills in that area are a little rusty and I don't need much of them in my current main project, but I sure don't want to do Swing development for ever.<&#47;li>
<li>And of course I will continue to read as much as possible about a wide range of topics.<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul><br />
I'm doing this because I actually think it is time to say good bye to Java. The development of Java stagnated in the past and I don't see any sign that its new owner is going to change that. So I need an alternative. For me that's Scala.</p>
<p>On the other hand I'm kind of confident, that the JVM will survive for quite some time in a state that makes it a strong, interesting platform.</p>
<p>Of course I'm no prophet. Maybe Google buys Java and within two years it is the coolest language on the planet ... if so, some Scala experience won't hurt, because a cool Java will certainly contain lots of features from Scala.</p>
<p>Maybe Scala dies or something bad happens to the JVM. In that case&Acirc;&nbsp; the broad range of programming concepts will make it easy to switch to any language of interest. So I'm feeling confident that my future as a software developer stays safe and interesting.</p>
<p>If I'd stayed with Java as my main language I still would feel safe ... but I'd be not so sure about the 'interesting' part.</p>
