<p>There are two difficulties when trying to change:</p>
<p>First is finding the right scope of change. You might just not be able to bring peace to the world. But YOU CAN change the way YOU interact with people. YOU CAN teach people how to solve a problem YOU solved.</p>

YOU CAN pair with a coworker in order to learn and teach.YOU CAN leave the code base a little cleaner then you found it.
