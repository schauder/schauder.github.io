<p>I try to do TDD as much as I can. But sometimes (for example last Friday) I don't know how to get started. This happens when I don't have a plan of how the code should look in the end, possibly because don't completely understand part of the problem. Especially I didn't know how I would be able to test it, due to the fact it the code had to interact with a different system and a database.</p>
<p>The <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.amazon.de&#47;gp&#47;product&#47;020161622X?ie=UTF8&tag=schauderhafte-21&linkCode=shr&camp=3206&creative=21426&creativeASIN=020161622X&ref_=sr_1_1&qid=1324160771&sr=8-1">pragmatic programmer<&#47;a> recommends a tracer bullet or spike in this case. This means you implement some kind of prototype in order to clarify how to implement it properly. </p>
<p>And than you throw that away and implement it properly again, which for me means test driven.</p>
<p>Do you really do that? For me this goes against the principle of baby steps and of refactoring instead of rewriting code. </p>
<p>Also I was fearing it wouldn't help much, because the problem wasn't so much that I was unclear about the code, but about how to test it.</p>
<p>So last Friday I tried a different approach. I call it 'Sketch and Test' </p>
<p>I started by implementing the complete thing in one single class. Without tests (scary, I know). But I never actually executed the code. I just wrote it as I thought it should work. </p>
<p>Once this <strong>sketch<&#47;strong> was finished I looked at the code and considered the changes I needed to make in order to test it. </p>
<p>I did the changes and finally created the tests, fixing the bugs I found in the progress.</p>
<p>Only when all the tests where in place and green I actually started the application and tested the new feature. </p>
<p>It worked, i.e. the feature did what I expected. The code qualifies as clean and I had complete code coverage with the only exception of some weird exception handling code, that I found hard to trigger in tests.</p>
<p>What do you think? Is this a viable approach? Or is it just a symptom of my limited TDD skills? Or both?</p>
