<p>Back in the days when I had my lack of experience as an excuse to explain my mistakes I was sometimes wondering: "Wouldn't it be nice to have a mentor?"</p>
<p>What I didn't realize until a couple months ago was that my mentors were all around me all the time.</p>
<ul>
<li>My cousin who introduced me to computers<&#47;li>
<li>A coworker who pointed out the limitations of VB to me<&#47;li>
<li>A coworker in California who tought me lots and lots of things about Oracle databases and how to have fun.<&#47;li>
<li>My boss(es) nudging me more or less toward project management<&#47;li>
<li>A coworker making it very clear to me that there are alternatives to project management<&#47;li>
<li>Another coworker who taught me even more about databases<&#47;li>
<li>Dozens, no hundreds of people writing blogs for me to read, questions to be answered or answered questions written by me in various forums.<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul><br />
Its just that I never realized they were my mentors (nor did they in many cases). By not realizing this I missed out on some greate opportunities to learn much much more, much much faster than I actually did.</p>
<p>So let me be your mentor for a second and give you a little task:</p>
<p>Think for a moment: Who in your vicinity is where you want to be in a couple of years? Who can help you getting there? Whom are you learning from? Whom could you learn from?</p>
<p>Now use my advice and <a href="&#47;2010&#47;11&#47;01&#47;just-ask&#47;">just ask<&#47;a> her to become your mentor.</p>
