<p>I wrote before about how you can emulate named parameters in a Java, either <a href="&#47;2012&#47;07&#47;29&#47;named-parameters-in-java&#47;">using methods<&#47;a> or a <a href="&#47;2012&#47;08&#47;05&#47;named-parameters-in-java-an-alternative&#47;">builder<&#47;a>. There is another approach, which already got <a href="&#47;2012&#47;08&#47;05&#47;named-parameters-in-java-an-alternative&#47;comment-page-1&#47;#comment-7869">mentioned in the comments<&#47;a>.</p>
<p>On the usage side it looks like this:</p>
<pre lang="java">
    doSomething4(new ParameterObject() );<br />
<&#47;pre></p>
<p>I find this solution interesting, because it looks seriously weird. At least it did to me when I saw it for the first time, and also to many others who I observed when they encountered it for the first time. So what the heck are we exactly looking at?</p>
<pre lang="java">
    doSomething4(new ParameterObject() {<br />
	&#47;&#47;...<br />
	});<br />
<&#47;pre></p>
<p>Is an anonymous subclass of <tt>ParameterObject<&#47;tt>, which is defined like this</p>
<pre lang="java">
    class ParameterObject {<br />
        protected String name;<br />
        protected String link;<br />
        protected int ultimateAnswer;<br />
        protected String tempFile;<br />
        protected int zip;<br />
    }<br />
<&#47;pre></p>
<p>so it is just a bunch of fields. The part that throws many people of is the nested set of {...} it is a java feature that doesn't get much usage: an <a href="http:&#47;&#47;docs.oracle.com&#47;javase&#47;specs&#47;jls&#47;se7&#47;html&#47;jls-8.html#jls-8.6">initializer<&#47;a>. It is similar to a constructor, but can't take any arguments. It gets executed before any constructor and in this case just sets the fields of the <tt>ParameterObject<&#47;tt> to the desired values.</p>
<p>Appart from the "WTF is this?" effect I don't find much good things about this approach, especially because it is so confusing for many people. It saves a little typing on the implementor side of the interface I guess, but then you have this <tt>new WhatEverStuff()<&#47;tt> on the client side, which doesn't help readability much.</p>
<p>Initializers and their siblings <a href="http:&#47;&#47;docs.oracle.com&#47;javase&#47;specs&#47;jls&#47;se7&#47;html&#47;jls-8.html#jls-8.7">static intializers<&#47;a> do belong in the toolbox of every java developer though.</p>
