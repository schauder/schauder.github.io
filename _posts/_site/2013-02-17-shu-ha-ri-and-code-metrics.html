<p>Code Metrics sure get mixed feelings by developers, especially when combined with thresholds to form checks that might make a CI build fail. Typical examples are:</p>
<blockquote><p>Line based code coverage &Acirc;&nbsp;must not fall below 80%.<&#47;blockquote></p>
<blockquote><p>A method must not be longer than 15 lines of code.<&#47;blockquote></p>
<p>Arguments against such rules state there are cases where such checks limit the freedom of a developer.<br />
During a discussion around these things it occurred to me that the metrics and checks come from a different skill level than the arguments against them.</p>
<p>Let me introduce <a href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Shuhari">Shuhari<&#47;a>: </p>
<p>Shuhari is a Japanese martial arts concept describing the stages of learning to mastery. </p>
<p>Shu describes the strict adherence to rules as one does when one begins to learn. This is where metrics live. They are strict rules. As a practitioner you just follow the rules without really thinking about them.</p>
<p>Ha describes the bending, changing and breaking of rules, as you might do when you are quite experienced.</p>
<p>Ri finally is described as transcendence, i.e. the rules don't really have a meaning to a master on this level. She just knows what to do.</p>
<p>I think one can easily see how metrics get in the way of a master at the higher levels. Right? But there is an interesting point in the short  Wikipedia article for Shuhari:</p>
<blockquote><p>Shuhari can be considered as concentric circles, with Shu within Ha, and both Shu and Ha within Ri. The fundamental techniques and knowledge do not change.<&#47;blockquote></p>
<p>For me this means: While a master can and will break rules at will, most of the time she won't because the rules align with what is the right thing to do (tm).</p>
<p>So if you think those code metrics are stupid and shouldn't apply to your code, you are welcome to prove to me that you are a Ri level master (I'm certainly not). A first indicator would be that you can follow those rules without them actually being enforced.</p>
<p>But if you are constantly breaking builds due to Checkstyle, PMD and Sonar violations, you are not demonstrating mastership but sloppy working.</p>
