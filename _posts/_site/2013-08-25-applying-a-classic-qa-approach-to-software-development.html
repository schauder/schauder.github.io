<p>My father was Quality Manager in a company that produced card board boxes for<br />
cigarettes, pralines and stuff.</p>
<p>When he tested (i.e. inspected) a batch of boxes, he took a sampling and checked various criteria like the coloring the alignment of different colors.</p>
<p>Then there were a couple possible options:</p>
<ul>
<li>If almost no problems were found, the batch was shipped to the customer.<&#47;li>
<li>If some problems where found, people had to go through all of the batch and sort out the bad ones. The good ones got shipped to the customer.<&#47;li>
<li>If to many of the samples were bad, the complete batch was scrapped.<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul><br />
Of course scrapping a production batch is expensive and a lot of effort was made to avoid it. But it was a valid option to prevent unusable products to show up at the customers door step, which was the wortst thing that could possibly happen.</p>
<p>In software development I most of the time see a process which only consideres the first two options after testing:</p>
<ul>
<li>If there are no, or very few bugs the software gets shipped.<&#47;li>
<li>If there are to many bugs the bugs get fixed and the software gets tested again.<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul><br />
Often this gets iterated until the first option is achieved.</p>
<p>There are good reasons for the difference of course. Scrapping a piece of software is very expensive. Most of the time way more expensive then scrapping even lots of palettes full of card bord boxes.</p>
<p>But there are cases where the third option should be considered.</p>
<p>What if you have very few testers, compared to developers? What if the developers produce really bad code? What would happen if you tell them:</p>
<p>"We gonna look at 2% of the stuff you deliver. And if we find more then x bugs the complete feature will get scrapped. We won't accept a fixed version. We require a complete new version and we want to know what you will do differently this time to ensure the next version is way better then then this one."</p>
<p>Of course this puts a lot of pressure on the developers. It's certainly very frustrating to get the work of weeks rejected like this. Certainly nothing you want to do with a healthy team that had a single bad sprint.</p>
<p>But maybe an option when a team constantly fails to deliver shippable software and you only pile up crap without making progress.</p>
